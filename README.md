This repository contains the smart contract implementation for the Early Access Program (EAP) designed for Jecta's beta version. The primary objective of the Early Access Program is to foster the development of a more advanced and efficient AI Copilot for the Injective ecosystem, leveraging valuable contributions and feedback from the community. Additionally, the EAP features a referral program to incentivize and reward contributors for their participation and support in shaping the future of Jectaâ€™s AI Copilot.
